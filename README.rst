A miscellany of code, either half-discarded after being written to see if it
could be done, or waiting to find a better home in a "real" project.

Stored to a public repository in case some of it turns out useful beyond my own
projects.

So far contains:
    - Some smith numbers experimentation, inspired by numberphile

        smith_numbers.py
        prime_factors.py
